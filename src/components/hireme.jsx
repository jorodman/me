              <h2>What I'm Seeking</h2>
              <p>
                I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2022 that will challenge me not only to learn more about Software Development,
                  but more importantly one where I get to work on a project that I'm passionate about, solving real world problems or
                  delivering consumers a new type of product.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                  I'm really interested in personal finance, teaching, music, the outdoors, and sports.
                  I would love to apply my tech skills to a project in one of these areas -
                  that could mean working in finance to develop software that teaches college students personal finance,
                  it could be working on a digital permit and parking payment system for REI,
                  it could mean developing a social network extension for Spotify that connects people using on music taste,
                  or it could mean working with ESPN to develop an Tik-Tok like app delivering users highlights from their favorite teams.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                  The botton line is that I have innovative ideas in many of the areas I am intersted in, and
                  I would love to spend Summer 2022 working with a team to bring one or more of these ideas to life!
