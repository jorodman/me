              <p>
                  I plan to graduate in Spring 2023 and am looking for an opportunity that will challenge me to become a better developer and
                  one where I would have the opportunity to work on a project that I'm passionate about. While most of my experience is in
                  web development, I'm interested in all kinds of opportunities within technology where I can use programming to solve real
                  world problems.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                  I'm really interested in personal finance, teaching, music, the outdoors, and sports.
                  I would love to apply my tech skills to a project in one of these areas -
                  that could mean working in finance to develop software that teaches college students personal finance,
                  it could be building a digital parking payment system for REI,
                  it could mean developing a social network extension for Spotify that connects people using on music taste,
                  or it could mean working with ESPN on developing a Tik-Tok like app to better deliver sports highlights to fans.
