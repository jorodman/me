              <p>
                  I'm looking for an internship for Summer 2022 that will challenge me to become a better developer and
                  one where I would have the opportunity to work on a project that I'm passionate about.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                  I'm really interested in personal finance, teaching, music, the outdoors, and sports.
                  I would love to apply my tech skills to a project in one of these areas -
                  that could mean working in finance to develop software that teaches college students personal finance,
                  it could be building a digital parking payment system for REI,
                  it could mean developing a social network extension for Spotify that connects people using on music taste,
                  or it could mean working with ESPN on developing a Tik-Tok like app to better deliver sports highlights to fans.
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                  The bottom line is that I would love to work on a tech project that overlaps with something I'm interested in outside of tech.
                  I would love to work for a company that is already in one of those industries, but it would also be fun to be on a team of other interns,
                  and with the mentorship of senior software developers, deliver one of these ideas to consumers.
